# üìï Library Management System

The Minimal Library Management System is a full-stack application designed for small-scale library management. The frontend is a clean, responsive, and feature-rich client-side application built with React, TypeScript, Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query), and Tailwind CSS. The backend is a robust RESTful API built with Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and MongoDB (Mongoose). Together, they enable users to manage books, perform CRUD operations, borrow books, and view a borrow summary without requiring authentication.The system emphasizes a minimalist UI, intuitive user experience, robust type safety, and efficient state management. It supports core functionalities like book management, borrowing with availability tracking, data aggregation, and flexible querying, making it ideal for small libraries or educational purposes.

## ‚úÖ Business Logic
- Book Availability: Books with 0 copies are marked unavailable.
- Borrowing: Borrow quantity cannot exceed available copies; books become unavailable when copies reach 0.
- Optimistic Updates: UI reflects changes instantly, with rollback on API failure.
- Error Handling: User-friendly error messages via toast notifications.
